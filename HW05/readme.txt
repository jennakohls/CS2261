- once you go into open space, you will begin building a red wall
	- you cannot backtrack; once you start building, you must finish that wall
- you must reach a blue wall to finish building that wall; it will turn blue when you do
- if the balls collide with your in-progress red wall, you lose
- each block of blue you successfully build counts as a point - fill the screen (score 324 points) to win
